1. Requirements Gathering
Functional Requirements:
- Evaluate ad ranking algorithms performance
- Compare different ranking models
- Measure ad relevance and quality
- Track user engagement metrics
- Support A/B testing
- Generate performance reports
- Real-time evaluation capabilities
- Historical performance analysis

Non-Functional Requirements:
- Low latency evaluation (< 100ms)
- High accuracy in metrics calculation
- Scalability for millions of ads
- Data consistency across evaluations
- Real-time monitoring capabilities
- Historical data retention
- System reliability (99.9% uptime)

C. Core Components
1. Evaluation Service:
- Manages evaluation workflows
- Coordinates between different components
- Handles caching and optimization
- Provides APIs for evaluation requests

2. Model Evaluator:
- Performs model evaluation
- Calculates performance metrics
- Handles cross-validation
- Manages evaluation datasets

3. Metrics Calculator:
- Computes various performance metrics
- Handles statistical calculations
- Provides confidence intervals
- Normalizes scores

4. A/B Testing Service:
- Manages experiments
- Handles variant assignment
- Tracks conversions
- Calculates statistical significance

D. Scaling Considerations
1. Performance:
- Caching evaluation results
- Parallel processing of evaluations
- Batch processing for large datasets
- Optimized metric calculations

2. Scalability:
- Horizontal scaling of services
- Distributed processing
- Partitioned data storage
- Load balancing

3. Reliability:
- Redundant services
- Data backups
- Error handling
- Monitoring and alerts
