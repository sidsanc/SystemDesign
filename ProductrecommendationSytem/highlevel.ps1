# 1. Requirements Gathering
# Functional Requirements:
# Provide personalized product recommendations to users
# Support different types of recommendations (similar products, popular items, etc.)
# Track user interactions (views, purchases, ratings)
# Allow real-time updates of user preferences
# Support multiple recommendation algorithms
# Enable A/B testing of different recommendation strategies

# Non-Functional Requirements:
# Low latency (recommendations should load < 200ms)
# High availability (99.9% uptime)
# Scalability to handle millions of users/products
# Data consistency for user interactions
# Privacy and data security compliance



# 4. Component Details
# Client Layer:
# - Web/Mobile interfaces for users
# - Real-time recommendation display
# - User interaction tracking

# API Gateway:
# - Request routing
# - Authentication/Authorization
# - Rate limiting
# - Request/Response transformation

# Core Services:
# 1. Recommendation Service:
#  - Handles recommendation requests
#  - Implements recommendation algorithms
#  - Manages recommendation caching

# 2. User Service:
#  - Manages user profiles
#  - Tracks user preferences
#  - Handles user authentication

# 3. Product Service:
# Manages product catalog
#  - Handles product metadata
#  - Updates product availability

# 4. Analytics Service:
#  - Tracks user interactions
#  - Generates reports
#  - Provides insights for model training

# 6. Scaling Considerations
# Performance:
# - Cache frequently accessed recommendations
# - Use CDN for product images
# - Implement database indexing
# - Use feature store for ML features

# Scalability:
# - Horizontal scaling of services
# - Database sharding
# - Distributed caching
# - Asynchronous processing

# Reliability:
# - Service redundancy
# - Data replication
# - Circuit breakers
# - Fallback recommendations

# 7. Additional Features
# A/B Testing:
# - Test different recommendation algorithms
# - Measure conversion rates
# - Compare algorithm performance
# Monitoring:
# - Track recommendation quality
# - Monitor system performance
# - Alert on anomalies
